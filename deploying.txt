//DEPLOYING REACT as static content
it's important to remember that the starting page of the app
	(examply mysite.com/my-app) loads index.js and is set on the
	BroswerRouter to load reacct content and the pages.
	Also the server must always load index.js if it goes to other
	pages since index.js is the one aware of paths via Routing.
